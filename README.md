# PyconAr GraphQL Playground
`PyconAr GraphQL Playground` is a playground for anyone who wants to learn graphql interactively.

![Screenshot](pyconar/static/demo.png)
The repo has different kind of query resolvers, backed by
- DB Models
- JSON Files
- REST Calls

This is to demonstrate that there are no hard constraints on implementation details.
We're free to do whatever fits better in our tech stack.

✨ [Live Demo](https://pyconar.herokuapp.com/) ✨

## About GraphQL
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a new paradigm in API Design that is rapidly growing in popularity.
Although it's not a replacement of REST, it does help solve some of its most frequent problems.
I hope that exploring the API you can get a taste of the benefits of GraphQL and perhaps motivate you to write your own GraphQL PoC for your next big project.


## TODO
- DoS Protection
- Remove custom GraphiQL html as it has bugs
- Improve Mutations Auth
